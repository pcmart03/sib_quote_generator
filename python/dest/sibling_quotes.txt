", "My typically-developing sister and I had a wonderful neighbor. Although she had her own children, she always took time to talk to us about what we were up to. I enjoyed art, and my sister enjoyed writing, and she was the one adult in our lives who knew anything about our passions.

This made it seem fair. They protected my right to privacy. ", "When my dad was alive, he was adamant that we were not to be treated differently within the family. After he died, my mom always made sure that we knew that we were all special and that we were going to be okay.  She sought out resources so my brother could become independent as possible.  She also sought resources that allowed me to go to school and start a career. Our dreams were never downplayed or put second to anything.

Expectations were high. For example, we went on family bike rides.  She wanted to go but wouldn&#39;t pedal her own bike.  My parents knew she was capable.

I think they did this for their own peace of mind and also for my well-being. ", "My dad took me aside for a heart-to-heart conversation. He became pretty emotional and told me he was sorry that my sister was a burden and that they tried very hard to make it not be. I never really thought of her as a burden and taking care of her after they passed was always the obvious choice for me. But it meant a lot to me to hear that from him. ", "My father passed away when my mother was pregnant with my sibling, so my mother worked long hours. My sister and I were caregivers for our brother, and our mother always made it clear that we would always be our brother&#39;s caregivers.

As adult, I assume some responsibilities, but because of my parents&#39; approach, I&#39;m very close with my sib and involved in his care&mdash;with no resentment.

While she was planning, she would always talk about how important this was for my brother&mdash;which it absolutely was.  But I realize now the impact this had on me.

There were months in which that didn&#39;t happen, but they always wanted it.", "My parents definitely supported all of us going to college, having our own careers and lives.

Amazing.", "They always made an effort to let me know that I had permission to live my own life and supported me no matter what.  When I was younger my brother got more attention then I did.

I was far less nervous about moving away and going to college because of that.", "After high school, I had a conversation with my dad about my sister&#39;s future. He thought I should live life as fully as I can and for as long as I possibly can. He told me that when I&#39;m older, when the time comes to plan for Lindsey&#39;s future, we would cross that bridge together.

My brother is my life, but as a child and as a teen I was expected to care for my brother after school for several hours and often on weekends. Every three-month summer was spent home watching my brother. No after school activities or sports. No going to the pool when all my friends went.

I met other sibs and some lifelong friends who genuinely understand me and my brother.", "When I was younger my mom took me to a sibling panel where I spoke to younger kids about what it was like to be a sibling of a person with a disability. It really showed me that I wasn&#39;t alone. ", "Our pediatrician spent as much time on my concerns as she did on my sister&#39;s concerns. I always felt heard by her.", "My parents let us know they loved us equally, valued each of our interests equally, were aware of the strain that dealing with disability caused, and tried to address it.  Their efforts also let me know that they were open to hearing my views, questions, and problems.  Perhaps even more importantly, was that my parents allowed my sister&#39;s and my relationship to develop organically, without force or facilitation, and they enabled us to interact as sisters, not as caregiver/care recipient.", "Meeting other sibs helps so much!  It means the world to us to make new friends who won&#39;t judge our siblings&mdash;or us! ", "It&#39;s good to meet others who have a sibling with a disability.  They provide insights and know what my life is like on a daily basis.", "No one asked me what it was like to have a sibling with a disability until I was 17. Being asked to share my story&mdash;validation that my story actually mattered&mdash;gave me the chance to process that narrative in a way that helped me better understand who I was in relation to my sister. In dialogue, we learn far more about ourselves than we ever can when we are left talking to ourselves alone.", "We want to know that you know we are going through a tough time and that it is okay to have negative feelings about our sibling. Young siblings need to know that it is OK not to be perfect and that they are just as important as their disabled sibling.  Often, we feel alone because we have no one else to talk to about our feelings.  The people that we want to talk to&mdash;our parents&mdash;are occupied with our disabled sibling. ", "Having open conversations about the challenges of having a sibling with a disability is a gift that a lot of siblings are never given. ", "It&#39;s important to offer support to siblings, through Sibshops or other groups where sibs can meet other sibs.  I think the best things parents can do for young sibs is to spend time with them, acknowledge difficulties, and provide an atmosphere where it is safe for all to voice their opinions and feelings, even when they are difficult.  Protecting siblings from physical or verbal aggressions (if the affected sibling has these) is really important too.", "What can we do to support young sibs?  Schools can connect students who are sibs with other sibs and make counseling a more available option.  Teach young sibs how to tell their friends about their sib.  Teach sibs self-defense if their sib has a tendency to be violent. Have respite services so that the sib and family can have a break every couple of months and experience life for a weekend as all typical people do. Let sibs be more involved in the choices affecting them.", "I want young sibs to have a &#34;safe place&#34; to express positive <em>and</em> negative feelings about their family. I want them to have people in their life who can give them regular, quality attention for themselves.  ", "I am a sib and work with young brothers and sisters.  Some have a hard time talking to people about difficult situations.  We have encouraged parents and siblings to share a journal that they can write to each other in. This gives them a chance to get their feelings out right away when their parents are not able to talk with them. ", "Young sibs don&#39;t always have a voice.  It brightens their world to know that they have been heard.  When they&#39;re heard, they can over come obstacles and live their life   to their absolute best. It lets them know that they are valued, they are acknowledged, and they are cared for.", "I think it&#39;s important for parents to acknowledge typically-developing siblings&#39; accomplishments, big AND small, even if it&#39;s just with a verbal &#34;well done&#34; or &#34;I&#39;m proud of you. and I hope you&#39;re proud of yourself, too.&#34;", "I also always really appreciated it when therapists and tutors would offer to let me participate in whatever they were doing. (Note the use of the word &#34;offer.&#34;  It has to be a choice, not a mandate.)", "We had to drive to see a doctor in another state every month. He made sure I was included in conversations and made sure I wasn&#39;t forgotten. He told my mom that every time we made the trip we had to do something fun. ", "My mom always listened to and valued my opinions about things that were going on with my brother.  She was careful to remember and remind people that I was a part of what was going on, too. I might not have made very helpful comments, but it made me feel like a part of his life instead of just a bystander.  Being included started me on a path to becoming an advocate for my brother. ", "Those who acknowledge siblings make us feel seen.  Too often, we feel invisible.", "Acknowledging sibs&#39; efforts makes us feel hopeful.", "My parents&#39; attitude regarding my sister&#39;s disability shaped my own beliefs. They helped me see the world as a rich, diverse place full of people who all deserve respect and love. ", "Even the smallest reassurance can make someone&#39;s day.", "My parents always showered me with love and affection. When it came time to talk to them about something, they would focus all their attention on me. ", "Because my sib had many needs, my parents didn&#39;t always have time to focus solely on me.  Still, they let me know that I was loved and appreciated.  Hearing this can make up for all the attention your sib might be getting. ", "Give the kids a hug! That&#39;s one of the best things you can do. Hugs feel great."]
