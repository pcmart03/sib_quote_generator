# Sibling Support Quote Generator

This project is a prototype of a widget that the Sibling Support network asked me to [build for their website](https://www.siblingsupport.org/). It randomly selects a quote from a list and displays it on the home page. The user can click a button and generate another quote.

It's coded mostly in vanilla javaScript. There's also a python script for extracting the text from the word doc and putting it in a more usable form.
